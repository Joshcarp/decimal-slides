# Title
How I learned go through writing a library

# Abstract
Go is known as an easy language to get started with, but how easy is it for a first year uni student to get the grasp of?
I had finished two units of programming when I got the opportunity to work on an open source go project; Implementing a decimal datatype in go.
In this talk I will be talking about how I went from not even knowing what Go was to developing an implementation of a fixed precision datatype in go, and my journey throughout.
As the infamous example of the failings of floating point numbers go; `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 != 0.3`
I was studying for my algorithms exam when I learned this, it didn't make much sense to me at the time;
- "Is this such a big problem, and if so, why is such a widely used "number" so fundamentally flawed?"
And so a couple of months go by and I get the opportunity to do a summer internship, and I start researching.
The problem goes; Computers count in base 2, so it's simply quick and easy to represent all components of a floating point number in base 2, although this is quick and easy, math gets  in the way.
- The first standard of this was introduced in 1985 and was the first time where all programming languages could speak a common language when it came to non-integer values.
- It had its fundamental problems, like the inability to represent decimal fractions
    - Just like 1/3 can't be represented as a decimal number, `1/10` can't be represented in a binary one.
    - In some cases this doesn't matter that much; any inaccuracies might cancel out; `1/10 * 10 == 1`
    - But in some other cases it won't and the problem is compounded;
        - Take an example of a system which counts every 10'th of a second
        - To start with this may not be that much of a problem as the error might be tiny, but if we've got a system which relies on precise calculations, we can very quickly run into problems.
        - for example; we've got some code which counts in 1/10th of a second, over 10 hours or so the actual time considered by the system is vastly off from the time we're expecting
        - This was actually the case for an anti missile defense system which had a system time which was 0.34 seconds out of sync, This error caused it to miss its target by around 500m.
        - This could've been avoided many ways; one of them being using a decimal data type instead.
So what's the solution?
    - Instead of storing the number in base 2, we can store it as base 10, and our infamous problem is solved: `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3`
I started working on this project, and I was possibly the most confused i've been in a long, long time.
I had the objective of implementing a the 754 2008 revision of the standard in golang, and that's where the journey began.
I didn't start from complete scratch; I was given quite a substantial code base already, and for someone who's biggest project in programming was probably copying code into unity and making a game it was a huge task.
So I started\





Hey all! So iâ€™m going to submit a paper for the Gophercon on the topic of my experiences with learning go through the decimal project and focusing on some of the background behind floating point and decimal datatypes, Here's a quick dot point of what i've got so far for a 20-ish minute talk, any feedback would be awesome!
```
- Started with go in December 2018
- Never worked on Go before, or even open source

- The ending of one of my programming class:
    - Introduction to floating point data types before
    - The problems with floating point data types
    - Repeated fractions `1/3 --> 0.3333333`, 1/3 can't be exactly represented in a deicmal system
    - 1/10 can't be exactly represented in a binary system
    - Example; `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 != 0.3` (in float)
- Real life example of bad code -> aviation and counting in 1/10th of a second
    - Compounding error can be a real problem

- Solution, I had never been
    - Base 10 counting system instead of base 2
        - Example; `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3` (in decimal)
    - IEEE 754R standard released in 2008
    - How this solves the 1/10th fraction issue
    - Anatomy of a Decimal floating point number
- My Goal; Implement a 64 bit decimal floating point library
    - Conform as closely to standard as practical
    - My plan "Write some test cases, Copy the code, change some 64's to 128's and done!"
    - I had never used unit tests before, let alone think about "Think of all conceivable edge cases"
        - More math and some of the problems I encountered with go
            - Inability to use 128 bit integers
            - Some examples of how this stopped me
    - Find IBM test suite online; "containing more than 81,300 tests"
- Benchmarking different programming languages; float vs decimal
- Benchmarking Other implementations in Go- https://github.com/shopspring/decimal
- Why Go *should* have a built in datatype
- How far the anz-bank/decimal has come, where it still needs to go
- End
```




- 128 Bit decimal floating point
    - Go doesn't support 128 bit integers
    - Concat of two 64 bit integers
- Fixed precision decimal vs Floating point benchmark
